# MIDAS
MATLAB Integrated Data Analysis Suite for UNLV's SAE Baja Team

#### Welcome,

This is Rebel Racing's first expedition into creating a MATLAB application to load, clean, organize, and analyze racing data. We hope that this project will allow us to more rapidly analyze our data collection, and use the information we gain to make  meaningful decisions on the future of the car.
